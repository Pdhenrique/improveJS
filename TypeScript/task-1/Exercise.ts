/*
Implement a function called FizzBuzz that takes a number as an argument.
Inside the function, print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3,
"Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5. 
If not divisible by either, print the number itself.
At the end of the file, call the FizzBuzz function with 
various numbers and print the results to the console.

FizzBuzz(3);   // Should print "Fizz"
FizzBuzz(5);   // Should print "Buzz"
FizzBuzz(15);  // Should print "FizzBuzz"
FizzBuzz(7);   // Should print "7"
