# Task: JavaScript - Prime Numbers

This task involves writing a JavaScript function to check if a given number is prime.

## Exercise

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `Exercise.js`.

2. Implement a function called `isPrime` that takes an integer as an argument.

3. Inside the function, check whether the number is prime. A prime number is one that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

4. Return `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.

5. At the end of the file, call the `isPrime` function with various numbers (some prime and some not) and print the results to the console.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Exercise.js

function isPrime(number) {
    // Implement prime number check here
}

console.log(isPrime(5));   // Should return true
console.log(isPrime(10));  // Should return false
```

## Guidelines

- You can use a loop to check for divisors of the number up to its square root.

- Remember to handle special cases, such as numbers smaller than 2.
