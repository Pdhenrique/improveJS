# Task: JavaScript - Reverse String

This task involves writing a JavaScript function to reverse a given string.

## Exercise

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `Exercise.js`.

2. Implement a function called `reverseString` that takes a string as an argument.

3. Inside the function, reverse the order of characters in the string.

4. Return the reversed string.

5. At the end of the file, call the `reverseString` function with a string of your choice and print both the original and reversed strings to the console.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Exercise.js

function reverseString(inputString) {
    // Implement string reversal here
}

const originalString = "hello";
const reversed = reverseString(originalString);
console.log("Original:", originalString);
console.log("Reversed:", reversed);
```

## Guidelines

- You can use a loop to iterate through the string from back to front and construct the reversed string.

- Alternatively, you can utilize string methods like split, reverse, and join.
