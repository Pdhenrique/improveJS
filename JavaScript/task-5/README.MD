# Task: JavaScript - Palindrome Check

This task involves writing a JavaScript function to check if a given word is a palindrome.

## Exercise

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `Exercise.js`.

2. Implement a function called `isPalindrome` that takes a string as an argument.

3. Inside the function, check whether the string is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards).

4. Return `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

5. At the end of the file, call the `isPalindrome` function with various strings (some palindromes and some not) and print the results to the console.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Exercise.js

function isPalindrome(word) {
    // Implement palindrome check here
}

console.log(isPalindrome("racecar")); // Should return true
console.log(isPalindrome("hello"));   // Should return false
```

## Guidelines

- Consider converting the string to lowercase (or uppercase) before the check to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- You can use a loop to compare the characters of the string forwards and backwards.
