# Task: JavaScript - Calculate Average

This task involves writing a JavaScript function to calculate the average of an array of numbers.

## Exercise

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `Exercise.js`.

2. Implement a function called `calculateAverage` that takes an array of numbers as an argument.

3. Inside the function, calculate the average of the numbers in the array.

4. Return the calculated average value.

5. At the end of the file, call the `calculateAverage` function with an array of numbers of your choice and print the result to the console.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Exercise.js

function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    // Implement the average calculation here
}

const numberArray = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const average = calculateAverage(numberArray);
console.log("The average is:", average);
```

## Guidelines

- Use a loop to iterate through the array and sum up the values.
- Divide the sum by the number of elements in the array to calculate the average.
